## Background on the challenge

There are four distinct prime numbers, each in the range 1 - 1000 which, when you multiply all four of them together, produce a certain 12-digit number. When you read this number's digits from left to right, each digit (starting with the second digit) is either the same as, or one more than, the previous digit.

 

**Your mission is to write a C# application to find and output the four prime numbers.**
